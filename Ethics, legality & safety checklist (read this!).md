Ethics, legality & safety checklist (read this!)

Only capture on NICs/VMs/networks you own or have explicit permission to monitor.

Do not capture or exfiltrate other people's private data.

Follow organizational policies and local laws — some jurisdictions require notification/consent for monitoring.

For labs, use isolated networks (virtual machines or lab VLANs).

Use capture filters to reduce accidental collection of unrelated traffic.

If you find sensitive data during authorized capture, follow your org’s incident handling / data protection procedures.
